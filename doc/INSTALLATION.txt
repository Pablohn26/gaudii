Follow these instructions to install Gaudii locally.

The libraries needed tu run Gaudii are:

- Ruby - http://www.ruby-lang.org/es/downloads/
- Ruby On Rails - http://www.rubyonrails.org.es/descargas.html (this includes Mongrel server)
- ImageMagick - http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php
- RMagick - http://rubyforge.org/projects/rmagick/
- OpenCV - http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/

After that, you need to compile the C and C++ files. 

C file (.c) is in:

/app/models/C/

C++ files (.cpp) are in: 

/app/models/openCV/

main.cpp file inside "face" folder must be compiled with the name "face" inside the same folder. 

main.cpp file inside "blob" folder must be compiled with the name "blob" inside the same folder.

Once compiled, you can run Gaudii by going to the root folder of the project and writing this in your Terminal:

gaudii$ script/server

This will launch the server. It will also show the address for accesing Gaudii:

=>Booting Mongrel
=>Rails 2.3.2 application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3000
=>Call with -d to detach 
=>Ctrl-C to shutdown server

Just put that address in your browser and you're done :)
