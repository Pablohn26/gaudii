Graphic Design is the process of creating graphics to meet specific commercial needs based on knowledge of layout principles and esthetic concepts. This is usually an iterative "trial and error" process which requieres a lot of time even for expert designers. This specific knowledge can be modelled, represented and used by a computer to perform design activities.

Gaudii (standing in Spanish for "Intelligent Automated Graphic Design Generator" (Generador AUtomatico de DIse√±os Inteligente) utilizes principles and techniques known from the field of Evolutionary Computation and Fuzzy Expert Systems to automatically obtain design elements.
